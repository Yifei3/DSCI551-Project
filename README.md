# Student Database Management System

## Description
This project consists of SQL scripts designed to set up and manage a comprehensive database system for a university setting. It includes scripts for creating databases, tables, and inserting records into tables such as `students`, `course_taken_by`, `professors`, and `courses`. 

## Installation
To run these scripts, you will need access to MySQL server on EC2 or locally.

## Usage
1. **Creating Databases and Tables**: Start by running the `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` commands to set up the initial structure.
2. **Populating Tables**: Use the `INSERT INTO` commands to populate the tables with initial data.
3. **Modifying Data**: Modify the scripts as needed to fit more specific requirements or to add more entries.
