# Student Database Management System

## Description
This project involves the development of a comprehensive university management system, incorporating both backend and frontend components to create a fully functional application. The back end is engineered using Python and PyMySQL, focusing on robust database operations such as dynamic database scaling and data validation for handling student, course, and professor information. Additionally, the database was meticulously set up with detailed data entries to reflect real-world usage. On the front end, a user-friendly web interface was designed to allow administrators and users to perform CRUD operations, ensuring easy management of the university's resources. This complete system supports efficient data handling and provides a seamless user experience for educational administration.

## Installation
To run SQL scripts, you will need access to MySQL server on EC2 or locally.
